# LP 2.4.5 mudlib with portals

## Overview

This is the old LP 2.4.5 mudlib that comes with the LDMud driver.

This mudlib is amended with the ability to travel to other MUDs via portals
for demonstration purposes. The git commits show which changes are necessary.

## License

All changes to implement the portals are given into public domain.

## Prerequisites

The mudlib needs LDMud 3.5 with additional Python patches
(https://github.com/amotzkau/ldmud/commits/35+python) and
the Python efun package for virtual interactives
(https://github.com/unitopia-de/python-interactives).

## Portals

The technology behind those portals are described in a usenet post:

If you want to setup a portal yourself, please contact Gnomi@UNItopia.
